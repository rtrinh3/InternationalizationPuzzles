These are my solutions to https://i18n-puzzles.com/ .

I usually run these in Visual Studio, but you should be able to run them from the command line.
The executable takes 2 arguments: the first is the puzzle number, the second can be either the literal input or the name of the file containing the input.

For example:
```
dotnet run 1 "input.txt"
InternationalizationPuzzles.exe 8 "k2lp79Ä…qV"
```

This repo also contains tests based on the examples and on my inputs.
